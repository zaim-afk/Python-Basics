# Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

This project is designed to introduce students to the fundamental concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python. By working through this project, students will learn how to create and work with:

- **Classes**: Blueprints for creating objects.
- **Objects**: Instances of a class that represent specific entities.
- **Attributes**: Properties or data associated with an object.
- **Methods**: Functions that define the behavior of an object.

Through practical examples and exercises, students will gain a deeper understanding of how OOP models real-world entities and makes code reusable and easier to manage.

The project includes:

1. Interactive coding tasks to define and use classes.
2. Real-world examples to demonstrate OOP principles.
3. Opportunities for creativity by designing their own classes and objects.

Get ready to explore the power of OOP and bring your ideas to life with Python!
